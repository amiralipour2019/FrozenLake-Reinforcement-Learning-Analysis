## Study Overview
- `Policy Iteration`: Investigates the convergence and efficiency of policy iteration in the Frozen Lake environment.
- `Value Iteration`: Examines the computational demands and performance of value iteration in similar conditions.
- `Stochastic vs. Deterministic Analysis`: Contrasts the outcomes of both algorithms under the deterministic and stochastic dynamics of the environment.

## Contents
- `policy_iteration.py`: Contains the code for implementing the policy iteration algorithm.
- `value_iteration.py`: Contains the code for implementing the value iteration algorithm.
- `environment_setup/`: Directory containing scripts to configure and modify the Frozen Lake environment for testing.
- `results/`: Includes the results and visualizations generated from the experiments.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project.

## How to Run
To replicate the study or explore the algorithms, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Execute the scripts for policy iteration and value iteration to observe their behavior in the Frozen Lake environment.

## Conclusions
The analysis provides insights into the suitability of policy and value iteration methods in different settings and paves the way for further exploration into adaptive learning strategies for complex and uncertain environments.
